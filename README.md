# CulFiT

**Official code implementation for ACL25 'CulFiT: A Fine-grained Cultural-aware LLM Training Paradigm via Multilingual Critique Data Synthesis'**



# Inference

we use [vllm](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) for fast inference

You can serve your vllm engin on 8000 port using

```shell
vllm serve "Qwen2.5" --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

# Data Generation

**Preparation**

all source data can be downloaded through https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gOoU8KXUiUASguRuBr0bJPVyYTj_t5Wh?usp=drive_link

**Generation**

We also provide the scripts for all our training data synthesis

```shell
bash ./src/scripts.sh
```
